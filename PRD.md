# Water Calculation Project :

My project aims to modernize the monthly water consumption calculation in Armenia through an automation system by Python programming language. This idea will make contribution to the acceleration of the calculation process as well as assuring privacy security , instead of capturing individual`s usage number and sending it via Viber and etc. In other words , it is faster and safer to use this method . The users should create their own accounts and sign in everytime to check data or input new ones . In case of suspicious insecurity , a notifying email will be send to the users` email addresses.

# Taregt Users :
Who : Armenian residents .
What : Automated Monthly Water Calculator.
When : As soon as possible . If it meets the government budget.
How : Both users and the water specialists/officers must be registered through the website . They can also download the app on their cell phones.

# User Problem Solved :
User need : Users will be able to observe their usage cost before paying it . 
Resolution : The calculator allows users to compute the consumed amount and obtain the final result on their own by inputing their usage number. The officers also can check the computation .

# User story :
Users can do the following tasks :
1. to create an account ,which includes Full Name , email , address , state , work place and age .
2. after that , to receive a UserID and password .
3. to check last months data , including date of usage , units for each type ( low , average , high) as well as their corresponding prices.In addition to this , they can check to see whether if their bills have been paid or not. 
4. to input new data such as date , unit and etc.
